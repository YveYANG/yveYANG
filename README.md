# YveYANG

Yve YANG Gallery is a newly established art gallery based in Boston. The gallery presents emerging and newly established artists from all over the world, and is devoted to exhibiting dynamic artwork through a diverse variety of mediums. Our artwork is characteristically conceptual and interdisciplinary in its nature. We believe great art is not just embellishment, but rather is an essential act that inspires the progression of human history.
